Now I can’t
get past the mezzanine,
never know who’s waiting
for me downstairs
by the revolving door
covered in shields or crosses
like the blood drive. Will this
be the year they finally succeed
in harvesting these last
self-organs, I ask, as they
tell me it’s for a cause?
As if I’m not the swollen one
smiling on their pamphlets.
Don’t bother with this logic
of sameness as you eye me
like the platter at labor lunch.
I used to envy the trees
wearing mists as veils,
modest trunks exploding into
thousands of muscle-bound
legs soon as they reach
the soil. Now even trees
seem docile and susceptible.
So too for the quasi-
goddesses with half-lives
shorter than a hair’s.
When we still had hair
and partners my partner
shaving said hair said
we should be made of light.
While every morning I
wake hoping to uncover
some slab of my body
hollowed out and encased
in steel. Everyone’s entitled
to her own magic bullet
theory of self. There’s
the get-to-know-you
game we play no longer
for we lost get-to and know-you.
If you had to press further into
the future in what county what
province would you elect
what version of what self?

A half-frozen field late
January. Tall, spare, lone
turbine thrashing by
the abandoned interstate.

I play my game.

I await the next campaign.
